  - push changes to Github to the branch, `part-01-initial-app`

    ```
    $ git checkout part-01-initial-app
    $ git push
    ```

  - merge changes into the master branch and push to Github

    ```
    $ git checkout master
    $ git merge part-01-initial-app
    $ git push
    ```

  - send me the link to your `part-01-initial-app` branch
